BoilerMake XI Submission: ** MLH Winner **

##Inspiration
The inspiration for Seek struck us during a personal experience of losing our AirPods. Frustrated with the traditional methods of posting on social media and retracing steps, I envisioned a platform tailored for Purdue students to simplify the process of finding lost items. The idea was to modernize the conventional lost and found bucket, providing a dedicated space for the Boilermaker community.

##Challenges we ran into
Through this project, we used new tools that we hadn't used ever before. This resulted in some technical issues when trying to navigate new frameworks. We had a challenge when incorporating our Maps API as well as using Redis Cloud. The journey from inspiration to implementation has been rewarding, and we are excited to see Seek serve as a valuable resource for Purdue students.

##What we learned
Throughout the journey of building Seek, we gained valuable insights into community-driven solutions and understanding the specific needs of Purdue students to shape our features. Through incorporating Redis Cloud for our cloud-based services, advanced full-stack development in React, HTML/CSS, and Node.js, and implementing Google Location API services for a more customized and reliable user experience, we gained thorough experience in what makes a web application successful. Using these technical tools in an effort to aid students in recovering lost items and create a tight-knit community, we learned a lot obout how our tools can be purposed to help communities effectively.

##What's next for Seek
The future of Seek holds exciting possibilities as we continue to enhance and expand the platform for Purdue students. In the future, we plan on implementing a reward system. This will be a point system where users earn points for various actions such as posting lost items, providing helpful information, and confirming matches. Accumulated points can then be redeemed for rewards, discounts, or exclusive perks.
