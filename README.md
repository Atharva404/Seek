BoilerMake XI Submission

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Seek struck us during a personal experience of losing our AirPods. Frustrated with the traditional methods of posting on social media and retracing steps, I envisioned a platform tailored for Purdue students to simplify the process of finding lost items. The idea was to modernize the conventional lost and found bucket, providing a dedicated space for the Boilermaker community.
